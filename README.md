# otto

DevOps Automation tool. There's a lot of tasks that involve us repeating the same things over and over again, so I wanted to automate those

## Name Origins

The name `otto` comes from the Vermont Technical College radio station automation software. `otto`
handles (handled? - not sure if it's still used, it was a gross mess of Perl written by college students)
playing music and station IDs while there wasn't an active DJ. `otto` also handled scheduling requests taken
in over the Website.

## Completed Features

## Planned Features

* Installable by PIP
